# Behold.

I'm a grad student at Georgia Tech, majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I love working on software that negotiates with hardware to enable shiny new use cases. I'm also interested in the intersection of AI and hardware.

I intend to write on a variety of topics: technology that interests me, philosophy, and on occasion, subjects that don't fall in either camp.

All views expressed are my own, and may have been revised since the time of writing. 

Here's an unflattering picture from a few years ago.
